# Gender_Age_Detection
Gender and Age Detection using CV2
This project utilizes computer vision techniques and OpenCV library in Python to detect and classify the gender and approximate age of individuals in images or real-time video streams. By leveraging pre-trained deep learning models, the project accurately identifies and labels the gender (male/female) and age group (child, teenager, adult, senior) of detected faces.

Key Features:

Utilizes OpenCV and Python for image processing and computer vision tasks.
Implements pre-trained deep learning models to perform gender and age classification.
Provides real-time video analysis or batch processing of images for demographic analysis.
Supports accurate identification of gender and approximate age group of individuals.
Offers a user-friendly interface for easy integration and customization.
Installation:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/gender-age-detection.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage:

For real-time video analysis, run python main.py --video path/to/video/file
For batch processing of images, run python main.py --images path/to/images/folder
Please refer to the project's documentation for more detailed instructions, examples, and customization options.
